# Apply a Subscription Tier to an API

Once you [create required subscription throttle
policies](../monetize-subscriptions) and [set up the appropriate billing
plans](../set-up-billing-plans) to bill subscribers, you can apply
required subscription tiers to an API.

Let's take a look at the steps you need to follow to apply a
subscription tier to an API. Here, we will use the
`PizzaShack` API that you can create and publish by following
the instructions in [Create an
API](../../design-apis/design-new-rest-api) and [Publish an API](../../publish-apis/publish-an-api)

1.  In the API Publisher, browse to the
    `PizzaShack` API and click **EDIT API** .
2.  Navigate to the **Manage** tab, select **Platinum** from the
    **Subscription Tiers** list, and then click **Save & Publish**.    
    This applies the platinum tier to the
    `PizzaShack` API.

Now that you understand how to apply subscription tiers to APIs, next
let's take a look at how you can [subscribe to an API that has a
monetization plan](../subscribe-to-an-api-that-has-a-monetization-plan).
