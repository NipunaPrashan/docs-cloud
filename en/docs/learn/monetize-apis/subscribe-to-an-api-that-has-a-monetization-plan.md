# Subscribe to an API that has a Monetization Plan

WSO2 API Cloud allows API publishers to apply subscription tiers to APIs
via [API Monetization](../api-monetization-overview). Publishers can either apply
subscription tiers when creating an API or even at a later time
depending on the requirement.

An API publisher can apply one or more subscription tiers to an API
including commercial ones as well as free tiers. When subscription tiers
are applied to an API and you go to the API store to view APIs, you will
see a label (tag) on each API as follows:

!!! tip
    
    The  label (tag) is attached to each API depending on the subscription
    tiers applied to the API.
    

-   **FREE** : API only has free tiers.
-   **PAID** : API only has commercial tiers.
-   **FREEMIUM** : API has both commercial and free tiers.

The following section describes the steps you need to follow to
subscribe to an API that has a monetization plan. Here we will use the
`PizzaShack` API that you can create and publish by following
the instructions in [Create an
API](../../design-apis/design-new-rest-api) and [Publish an API](../../publish-apis/publish-an-api).

1.  Go to the API store and click on the
    `PizzaShack ` API to open it.
2.  Under **Applications** , select
    `DefaultApplication`.
3.  Under **Tiers** , select `Platinum`.
4.  Click **Subscribe**.   
    In this case you will be directed to a **Billing Information** page
    because you are subscribing to an API through a commercial tier.  
5.  Provide your billing information and then click **Proceed** . This
    takes you to the **Contact Information** page.
6.  Provide your contact information and then click **Proceed** . You
    will see an order summary.You will also receive an email with the invoice details. The invoice will be in a pre-defined template with the WSO2 logo and WSO2 as the
    service provider. If you need to customize this template with your
    company's logo, name, and other details, contact the WSO2 Cloud
    team via cloud@wso2.com.
