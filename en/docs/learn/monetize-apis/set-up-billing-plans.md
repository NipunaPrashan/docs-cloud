# Set Up Billing Plans

models for different subscription levels.

subscription throttle policies that they create.

    This adds the billing criteria for the relevant plan.

### Edit a billing plan

Follow the steps below to edit a billing plan that you set up:

1.  On the list of available plans, click **Edit** on a plan that you
    have already set up.
2.  Change required values.

    !!! note
    
        Note
    
        When you edit a billing plan, you cannot change the value of **Plan
        Name** and **Pricing** . This is to avoid confusions that can arise
        as a result of billing plan updates because **Plan Name** and
        **Pricing** changes can cause different customers on the same plan
        to have different price points.
    

3.  Click **Update** .
